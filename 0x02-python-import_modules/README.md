## Python - import & modules
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the Python programming language: importing modules and using definitions, not executing 
> prints when imported, ...

### Description of what each file shows:
Files that start with:
0. imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3
1. imports functions from the file calculator_1.py and prints examples of add, sub, mul, div
2. prints the number of and the list of its arguments
3. prints the addition of all arguments (Sample usage: ```./pythonscript 79 -3 10 8```)
4. prints specific content within the compiled module (curl -Lso "hidden_4.pyc" "https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x02.py/raw/master/hidden_4.pyc")
5. imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value
100. imports all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basics operations (Sample usage: ```./100-my_calculator.py 5 / 7 ```)
101. prints #pythoniscool via importing another file that prints it
102. write Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as below bytecode:
103. prints the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line
